# Hi, I am Abduallah (Aka. Ori6069 as a username).

I am a blend of web design and web development, with a growing intrest in AI model creation.
My toolkit includes Nicepage for design, HTML and JavaScript for development, Neocities for deployment, and the Notes app for planning and brainstorming.

My hobbies are Photography, Videography, Game Development, Graphic Design (Adobe software), and Gaming (Obviously)😁
